# Subnetting
Subnetting is a method of dividing a single physical network into logical sub-networks (subnets). Subnetting allows a business to expand its network without requiring a new network number from its Internet service provider. Subnetting helps to reduce the network traffic and also conceals network complexity. Subnetting is necessary when a single network number must be assigned to several portions of a local area network (LAN).

Subnetting splits networks into small subnets. A subnet, known as a subnetwork, is a part of a larger network. Subnets are the logical division of an IP network into many smaller network parts.
